## Create Github Account

In a web browser open [Github's webpage](https://github.com/) and select the ``Signup for Github`` option and follow the steps to creaqte you account.
You can use your personal or institutional ``edu`` email (or both). I suggest using you personal one to ensure it stays with you no matter the circumstances.
